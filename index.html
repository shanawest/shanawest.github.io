  <div class="row">
     <p class="about">
Shana's favorite projects challenge her to make sense of sticky, complex problem spaces and processes. Though she loves B2C, her sweet spot has become B2B, enterprise, and internal tools. As a senior product designer at Iora Health, Shana grappled with medical data, HIPAA compliance, CEHRT, and ICD-10 billing codes in a proprietary EMR. Prior to joining Iora, she was an experience designer at Nerdery. Her skill set includes business discovery, user research, experience strategy, product roadmapping, service design, information architecture, WCAG 2.0 AA-conformant design, and interaction design for web, mobile, and desktop applications. She has worked in human-centered design since 2008.      </p>
      <p class="about">
Shana is excited to work on projects helping people work efficiently, make decisions, and change habits, and seeks to provoke curiosity, conversation, and collaboration through digital experiences. She got her start in human-centered, evidence-based design as an interactive exhibit developer, telling stories about science and history with an emphasis on people and the environment.      </p>
